# artificial neuron
there was a creature wans that look like the  peon on chess and this criture had thougts that where preaty basic and 
complex at the same time, first, the lenguge it  understood was matematics, only that, so  it only  
spoke numbers and heard numbers, and the thougth that it  had where eather a linear regration  or a  logistic regration,
sow if you tell them numbers it " imagine  a line that fit  the best those numbers,  or a squigle  that put a limit
on wich 2 clases of numbers where  separated eather way in a matematic sens this toughts where lineal
# neural networkl
now imagine 2 lines of peons  the peons dont talk to the one bisides them but it talks to all the peons
 in the line infront of them,
#types of neural networks
 - Fnn: this feed forward architecture is used  for clasification problems whit structure data, and are escential to all oter types	
 - cnns: apply a matematical operation  called convolution, to proces spatial information that comes in a grid like format
	by default, like images and videos.
 - rnns are really good  for secuential time  data like oudio LSTMs for example have  a  feedback loop, in their
neurons that allowthem  short term memory
 - auto encoders compress and decompress the information, and they can be deep ( many layers) , the idea is that
 you can filter the noise in  a bunch of information to capure the escense  play with it and then give back the information 
mor less as it was give to you 
- transformers
-gans
