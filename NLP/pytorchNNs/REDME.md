# Conection to  google colab from vscode troug a jupyter derver

✅ Confidence: High

Got it — thanks for clarifying! You want to **use Colab’s GPUs** but connect from **VS Code** (so you can stay in your accessible workflow with your screen reader).

There are a couple of ways to do this. Let me break them down:

---

## 🔹 Option 1: Use Colab’s built-in VS Code connector

Google Colab recently added an **“Open in VS Code”** feature.

* When you open a notebook in Colab, go to **File → Open in VS Code**.
* This launches a VS Code instance in your browser, backed by Colab’s runtime (with GPU).
* Downside: it’s browser-based VS Code, not your local desktop one. Accessibility might depend on your screen reader + browser.

---

## 🔹 Option 2: Connect your local VS Code to Colab via SSH (recommended for accessibility)

1. **Install VS Code extensions**

   * Install [**Remote - SSH**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh).
   * Install [**Python**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python).

2. **Set up an SSH tunnel to Colab**
   Since Colab doesn’t give direct SSH access, people use `colab_ssh` (wrapper around `ngrok` or `cloudflared`).

   Example in a Colab notebook:

   ```python
   !pip install colab_ssh --upgrade
   from colab_ssh import launch_ssh
   launch_ssh("YOUR_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN", "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME")
   ```

   * This prints an SSH command like:

     ```bash
     ssh -p 22 root@X.tcp.ngrok.io
     ```
   * Copy that.

3. **Connect from VS Code (local)**

   * Open Command Palette → “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…”
   * Paste the SSH command from Colab.
   * You’re now inside Colab’s VM with GPU, but editing + running from your local VS Code.

⚠️ Note: Ngrok has changed its free tier (v1 → v2), so instead of ngrok you may want to use **cloudflared** (free tunneling tool).

---

## 🔹 Option 3: Skip Colab, use free cloud Jupyter servers

If ngrok feels messy, alternatives:

* **Kaggle Notebooks** → free GPUs, browser-based (but less direct VS Code integration).
* **SageMaker Studio Lab (AWS)** → free, has direct VS Code desktop connect.

### 🔑 Rule of Thumb for Accessibility

If your main barrier is **navigating Colab UI with a screen reader**, then **Option 2 (Remote SSH)** is your best bet → full local VS Code accessibility, while still using Colab’s GPU.

👉 Do you want me to write you a **ready-to-run Colab snippet with cloudflared SSH tunneling**, so you can just paste it and connect from your local VS Code?
