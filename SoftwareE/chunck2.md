# From prehistoric times to you

in the beggining  computers were this huge thing you needed a big room just to have ona  computer, and they did not had OS, no 
 you worote the program and wait for the outbut in a paper recive like format. one program at a time, but then running more 
than 1 program  a a time was needed here is when  the firsts OS were build, to run in servers because in the 70s perconal 
computers or PCs weren't a thing, this is how  UNIX and BSM were born . there were a hol lot more but  from this 2  the
 Operative sistems from today were born. from the second one  sun microsistems and FreeBsd were created, then xeros laboratory
 created a computer with something really extrange call mouse, and a wear interface were you didnt type commands to interact
 with the computer but it show you avery thing in windows with grafic icons and u use the mouse  to select this icons.

Well this guys decided to give a walk to its installations to some friendly folks, lets call them the steves they had a 
company with the logo of an apple but have never sell fruit, these guys  basicly ripped of the ideas of xerox laboratory
and made them popular in the future but  it was  hard to  implement this ideas they were having  some problems  so they ask for
help to a friendly folk call bill.

Bill used his moms contacts in IBM to convince them that they had a great OS to sell then went and buy and operative system 
for pcs not for servers that was created  buy other guys named DOS and this is how IBM PCs started runnin microsoft DOS.
So bill went to help his good friend steve, because bill was a good programmer he took a peak to their code. 
Now we have microsoft windows and MacOS 

Let us now pay atention to the most popular OS in the hole planet, that is rigth Linux.

Created by linus torbals and apalancado in the GNU proyect and ideas and with the help of some other projects but mainly 
and more important  with the framework of FREE software, but not FREE as with no cost, but FREE as  FREEDOM, onece yours, 
you can see the code and manipulate it, a lot of enterprise used linux to create and mantain open source projects 
(onece up on a time bill hated open source and try to destroy all of them) now we have diferent flavors of linux
 (ubuntu, archi,fedora,mint) running in all kinds of servers and personal computers but specially we have  a flavor of linux 
call android that runs in every pocket computer call phone (and windows now loves open source).

and here we are you had just turn on your device (phone or pc) and want to share some files  with some friends via internet.
what happens now ?
## the file system and extentions

If you are to used to your phone when you think of  searching a file aka a photo of a pdf, you think in terms of apps,but 
it has never been this way, the thing is that there is something cole files sistem that is  a sistem of folders and files
sort in a particular way , the apps access this system but the phone doesnt show it to you. In PCs it's starting to happen 
the same in the adress bar of your windows file explorer  you dont see the **"file path"** but some names.

 - in windows the root of your files is  C: and is the same as the root of your  Drive (SSD or HHD)
 - In linux based sistems is / and is not the same of your disk  your disk is on "/mnt/C"

Any way in both there are 3 types of folders 

 - users or usr: Here there is a cummon folder named home, were all the data of your user is saved, also could happen
that you encouter OS files or Apps files that are just for that user to use.

 - apps or program files: Files your apps of programms need to  run and properly function

 - OS files: the central files for your kernel to properly work

same is happening with extentions. they are never shown in phones  or pcs by default, extentions are  3 or for letters that follows  a dot  after  
the file name, they tell you and que OS what type of file is that one. Depending on the extention the OS and you  can 
wait for a structure and format of the data inside lets revew some cummon extentions

- txt: For plain text files
- JPG :Join Photographic experts Grup: a standar of images files
- mp4: A containner for videos. Video files are aa composition fo  a codec file an audio file and a subtitles file 
 the extension of this files are H264 mp3 and osr
- zip: Compress file that ses frequency  and binary trees to build a compression algoritm see the compress.py
file in the repo for a little insigth
- csv: Coma separated values  a format very cummon for  tabulated data, but they are not data base files.

all files  have something call  header same as the formats of non volatil memories (drives) hete the first
 4 letters are the extention of the file then there is other information call meta data is information about the dile
you can see all this if you use a hexadecimal text editor.

## Data bases 

they can be relational and non relational. The non relational can be grpah  based or  document based,
 or you also could have key  value databases like reds . The relational data bases are the most cummon i thnik because 
the oldest ones, the purpuse of all data bases is to avoid redundancie on the data structure but to bee eassyly write and read and also to store humungus amounts of data for this  the languge SQL is used, the most cummon data base engines used are sqlite,
my sql, oracle and  postgress. why this matters well now you found your file or photo and you atept to save it in  the internet
in some one else data base ( a social network and email service , a message service you pick) let us connect to the internet.
