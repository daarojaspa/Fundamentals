a message from your friend: " have you already upload the photo ?" a simple thing that enmarcaretes a complex 
and humongus network of cables  and protocols that allows you tow to comunicate, lets dive alittle deep in to the internet

First  you and your friends  exchanged keys when you ttoo added eachother in (message app) now when she pressed send
the message she wrote was encryped using the key  you give her, your public key, and when the message arrives at 
your phone before you even ipenned is de encrypted but with the key you did not share, your private key.
This protocols of having 2 keys, one private and one publlic, to share the public  so others  encrypt the messages they send you
and to de encrypt with your private key is call SSH. Now this only accounts for the security par.

## Bits and bytes
a bit is an interruptor that can be eather on or off, in electronic this normally  relates whit having a low voltage or current 
and is representet by a 0 and having a higth voltage or current  is represented by a 1 in a screen. A bit is eather a 0 or a 1
If you grup 8 bits you have a byte. and with a byte you can reprecent not 8 numbers but 256 numbers... how?

## Binary system
Imagine you have powers of 2  in an arrage from 2^0 to 2^7 and under this arrange you have an interruptor that decides if
 the power of to over it  is  sum to the grand total or not. that is a binary system. All the  8 bits on and you have a 255 and
then you can ad other codification systems on top of this one to use bytes to represent charts, like the utf-8 or the ASCCI

So your friends mesage is converted to aseries of bytes that are send via waves to the wifi router  on your friend 
howse or   one of the  cell phone antenas she her cell phone is connected to (more than one at the same time) then this devices 
convert it to and electrical signal that is sen via cable to a Internet Service provider that is 


## IP adressing and DNS

## server client model and http methods and errors
## domains and programming languajes
