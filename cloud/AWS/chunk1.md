The old way was,  each company bougth their server, that server is never turn of and if you needed a 
bigger server, move your headquarters, well abig tsk ahead, the virtual machines got really popular and developed,
if you had a lot of money you could make a  humungus  invertion  in buldings and servers  build virtual machines 
on those servers and then rent those virtual machines, thats how cloud computing was born, the cloud is just a bunch
of servers that you can use but that arent yours. avrage joe normaly just uses storage services, like drive,
 google photos,netflix,gmail,dropbox.
but you can use computing services, eg running your programs  on some one else computer using the internet 
as  comunication sistem, unlike the 50s were you used someone else computer (main frame) but had to be there to use it.

this business model allow small  plauers to have hacces to  top of the line hardware, at a lower cost, in a 
easy to scale fashion. now some extrange  acronims

-IaS: you pay for the virtual machines but you are in charge of  managing how u use them(os, storage,networks)
like a EC2 from AWS, use it  when need to train big models, or  have to do hevy computting (trainning)
-PaaS: the provider also handels os storage setings security ppatchs, is like hiring a  catering service,the provide the kitchen,
 the cooking and the ingridients, you pik the menu (what to run in that envroment) use it when need to serve models as APIs quikly(deploying)
-SaaS:You go out to a restaurant the menu is set, you pick what you want for example,  you pay for a
 prebuild monitoring services for a  ml that you have runin in a PaaS service and that ws train in a IaaS  virtual machine.
